<p>After the introduction of the Mercedes-Benz Maybach Vision 6, along with the continued development and partnership of Mercedes-AMG and the success of the Mercedes-AMG GT Roadster, Mercedes-Benz has continued their with the progress and production into the high end luxury vehicle market.</p>

<p>Now focusing on their new models, Mercedes-Benz has transitioned the Mercedes-Benz Vision 6 success and popularity into the Mercedes-Maybach S650 Cabriolet.</p>

<p>Mercedes-Benz has now begun to focus on convertibles of quality, luxury and safety, while developing some of the most luxurious models and surpassing many other luxury brands that have attempted to build a portfolio of entry-level to ultra premium across their brand models. Mercedes-Benz's head of design, Gorden Wagener, spends much of his time in Southern California and says, <blockquote>“Each convertible, in its ideal construction, would intrinsically vanquish any issues. The bad is the enemy of the good."</blockquote></p>

<p>With the unveiling of the Mercedes-Maybach S650 Cabriolet, an opulent vehicle priced at $323,000, Mercedes-Benz has entered the realm of the top of the line ultra luxury market.</p>

<p>Mercedes-Benz now has the opportunity to truly provide an alternative to those in the Bentley and Rolls-Royce high end market looking for quality and high end performance vehicles from luxury automobile manufacturers. Wagener states that <blockquote>"Mercedes-AMG is our performance brand so it's all about performance stuff," before he unveiled the Mercedes-Maybach S650 Cabriolet in Los Angeles.</blockquote>While the development of vehicles by Mercedes-Benz and Mercedes-AMG have produced quality performance vehicles, many have also excelled in being the ultimate in luxury.</p>

<p>The interior of the Mercedes-Maybach S650 is the haute couture of the automobile. The exterior is a superb appearance up front, with more chrome, more richness, and of course more branding than ever before.</p>

<p>Many believe the Mercedes-Benz S-Class, newly redesigned, is one of the best car’s in the world, but Mercedes-Benz wanted to raise the bar. It has been able to do so with the Mercedes-AMG partnership as well as their production of the Mercedes-Maybach vehicles.</p>

<p>Why does Mercedes-Benz need a flagship atop its flagship?</p>

<p>When Mercedes-Benz wants to obtain the ultimate in automotive luxury there is always the customer who, when he or she reaches the pinnacle, wants more.</p>

<p>A brand like Mercedes-Benz, one with deep pockets, can always innovate and progress. This lends truth to the Mercedes-Benz motto, the Best or Nothing.
<blockquote>"It's always our job to make it better," Wagener says. "Each little detail, the wood, the wood under cover of the cabriolet, the leathers. All the super luxury details that make a luxury car into a super luxury car. The key is to make a modern luxury design and not a traditional luxury design. There is definitely a market for traditional luxury, but we always wanted to have Mercedes, Maybach in particular, as a modern luxury car. That's why we chose this location here in the hills because the car is maybe more tasteful, in terms of beauty, according to our hot and cool philosophy – it's really hot but it's also really cool. So I love this definition of super luxury. "</blockquote> Mercedes-Benz is selling much more than chrome, fitted luggage and an interior of the highest quality with the Mercedes-Maybach S650 Cabriolet.</p>

<p>The Mercedes-Maybach S650 is an exclusive, 300 production limited edition, vehicle of excellence.</p>

<p>Each vehicle comes with a signed numbered plaque as well as the Double-M Maybach symbol on the trunk and flank. Many will recognize this vehicle as the ultimate in super luxury, giving Mercedes-Benz a continued market share in the high performance luxury category.</p>

<p>Some may believe that the level of luxury has a limit, but as Mercedes-Benz and Wagener say, "No...There's no limit."</p>
