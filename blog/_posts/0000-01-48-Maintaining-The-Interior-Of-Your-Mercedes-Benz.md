<p>Your Mercedes-Benz is your pride and joy...and for good reason. It's sleek, fast, reliable, and luxurious, especially the interior. You paid a little more and went with the natural bamboo trim and white leather seats. It's perfect. You love every part of it, and this worries you. How can you keep it this way?</p>

<p><strong>First Class Interior Protection</strong></p>

<p>You're not alone. Many people who drive a Mercedes-Benz worry about the interior. If you have <a href="{{ site.url }}/blog/kid-friendly-car-tech-for-your-mercedes-benz/">kids</a>, the anxiety is especially heightened. Stains, spills, crunched up cereal pieces, you name it, your interior isn't safe. Don't worry though, Mercedes-Benz thought about this. That's why they offer the <a href="{{ site.url }}/blog/third-party-warranties-when-purchasing-a-new-mercedes-benz/">First Class Interior Protection package</a>. For a little more money, you can protect your carpets, wood trim, and your leather seats. How does Mercedes-Benz do it?</p>

<p>They use DuPont™ Interior Protection. Yep, DuPont™ developed a protectant that increases the life of your interior and makes it easier to clean-up stains. It also protects against high temperatures, prevents cracks in your leather, and acts as a barrier to unwanted substances that attempt to penetrate your upholstery.</p>

<p><strong>What else can you do?</strong></p>

<p>After you drive away from the dealership, your car and the health of its interior are in your hands. Don't worry, there are several ways you can extend the life of your car's interior. Here are just a few:

<ul>
 	<li><strong>Steam cleaner</strong> - Don't just vacuum, use a steam cleaner. These boil water and turn it into vapor. This vapor breaks down dirt and debris, making it easier to vacuum. When cleaning your carpets, go the extra step and rent or buy a steam cleaner. This will ensure your carpets stay as clean as possible.</li>
 	<li><strong>Leather cleaner</strong> - Leather is temperamental. If it isn't taken care of, it can crack, split, and become loose. Spray some leather cleaner on a rag and wipe your leather seats periodically.</li>
 	<li><strong>Leather conditioner</strong> - Yes, this may seem redundant, but it isn't. Leather cleaner, as its name would suggest, cleans your leather. The conditioner keeps it young. It adds moisture to dry leather and keeps it <a href="{{ site.url }}/blog/11-must-have-products-to-keep- your-mercedes-benz-looking-new/">looking like new</a>.</li>
 	<li><strong>Steering wheel cleaner</strong> - You can't drive without a steering wheel. You need it, and you use it a lot. So, take care of it! If you don't, especially if it's made of leather, it will breakdown over time and will eventually need to be replaced or re-finished, which can be rather expensive.</li>
 	<li><strong>Stain remover</strong> - Do you have pets? If you do, you've likely used stain remover. This helps remove stains from carpeted services. Make sure the remover you buy is safe to use on your Mercedes-Benz carpet floors.</li>
 	<li><strong>Glass cleaners</strong> - Your glass needs to be maintained as well. You won't drive very well if you can't see out of your windows. The interior displays and other features are also made out of glass, so make sure you clean them as well.</li>
 	<li><strong>Wood polish and wax</strong> - Mercedes-Benz interiors include beautiful, natural wood trims. These are sturdy, but like anything else, they wear out over time. Keep them looking young and repair scratches with wood polish and wax.</li>
</ul></p>

<p><strong>Why should I care so much?</strong></p>

<p>While it may not be hard for us car nuts to understand, some people don't think it's worth the time, effort, or money to maintain the interior of their Mercedes-Benz. They know it's impossible to keep a car pristine, so they don't try. The chaos of life and the inevitability of careless passengers make all the upkeep seem foolish. Well, it's not.</p>

<p>Yes, the value of your vehicle depreciates the moment you drive off the lot. Don't be discouraged by this. Mercedes-Benz are well sought after, especially if they're kept in good condition. If you take the time to vacuum, wax, polish, and clean your interior, you won't have any trouble finding a buyer when it's time to sell.</p>

<p>If you have no intention to sell now or in the future, this is even more reason to take care of your car. <a href="{{ site.url }}/blog/mercedes-benz-safety/">Mercedes-Benz's vehicles are built to last</a>, but they can't do this alone. With little effort, you can keep your car on the road and the interior looking as good as it did when you bought it. Talk to your <a href="{{ site.url}}">Mercedes-Benz dealer</a> about interior protection packages, use the cleaning products mentioned above, and you'll help maintain the luxury and performance of your Mercedes-Benz.</p>
