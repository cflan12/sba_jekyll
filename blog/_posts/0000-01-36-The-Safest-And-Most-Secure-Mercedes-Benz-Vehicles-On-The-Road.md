<p>When people are looking for a luxury vehicle, there are several basic expectations that they expect. For example, the car should be comfortable with a plush interior. It should accelerate quickly from zero to 60. Most people are looking for a few fancy gadgets such as a cross-traffic alert system, advanced entertainment console, and a suite of navigational applications.</p>

<p>Most importantly, the vehicle should be safe. For people looking for the safest modified vehicles on the road, look no further than Mercedes-Benz. There are a few options that truly stand out from the pack when it comes to the safety of the driver and the passengers.</p>

<p><strong>The Mercedes-Benz S600 Guard Special Protection Modification</strong></p>

<p>To the untrained eye, this modified Mercedes-Benz vehicle may appear identical to the regular S-Class. While the standard vehicle is already a safe option, the S 600 option takes this Mercedes-Benz vehicle to an entirely new level.</p>

<p>For starters, the vehicle comes with armor plating. This means that the vehicle is designed to withstand fire from military-grade weapons, which are significantly stronger than the standard handguns that people might find on the street.</p>

<p>In addition, the S 600 protects against grenades and other potential explosions. The S 600 comes equipped with unique Michelin PAX tires that are designed to continue to run for almost 20 miles even if the tires are damaged. This ensures that people have the ability to find safety if their tires are damaged.</p>

<p>One of the commonly neglected regions of the car is the underneath carriage. Even this has the special armor plating, ensuring that debris and danger found on the surface of the road cannot damage the otherwise vulnerable undercarriage.</p>

<p>The vehicle also features a panic system, an automatically-activated fire extinguisher, and an advanced air purifier system to protect against gas or other noxious fumes that could enter the vehicle.</p>

<p><strong>The Mercedes-Benz Maybach Armored Limo Modification</strong></p>

<p>While Mercedes-Benz has developed an impressive track record of producing some of the most solid vehicles on the market, this takes it to a whole new level. Many of the modified safety vehicles sacrifice comfort for improved protection; however, this limo allows people to continue to travel in style while maintaining supreme safety.</p>

<p>A corporation out of Canada called the Inkas Armored Vehicle Manufacturing has taken the already safe Maybach and added several improvements. The Maybach is a safe car; however, it isn't designed to protect against bullets.</p>

<p>For around half a million dollars, they will add several layers of steel plating to ensure that everyone feels safe no matter where they're at. They also add a stronger suspension and braking system plus a smokescreen generator that can help conceal the vehicle during a getaway!</p>


<p><strong>Mercedes-Benz S600 VR10</strong></p>

<p>This is another modified Mercedes-Benz S 600; however, this one features a truly unique safety addition. While the S 600 is already a safe vehicle, the VR10addition is certified to protect against a special type of steel-tipped and steel-core bullets fired from military-grade assault rifles.</p>

<p>Created by the Ballistics Authority located in Germany, VR10 adds a completely new level of protection and represents a significant upgrade over the prior VR9 modified vehicle. The VR10 also features Aramid composite armor complete with anti-splintering technology in the windows to ensure that nobody gets hurt even when traveling through an active war zone.</p>

<p>Future heads of state who wish to invest in this level of safety will need to spend around half a million dollars for a sedan. Of course, those willing to spend more can probably receive this kind of protection on a limo as well!</p>

<p>These are only a few of the numerous examples of safety at its finest. Mercedes-Benz knows that the safety of its passengers should consistently be the top priority.</p>
