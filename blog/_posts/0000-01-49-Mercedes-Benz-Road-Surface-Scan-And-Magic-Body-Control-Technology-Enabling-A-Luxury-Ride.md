<p>New technological innovations from Mercedes-Benz now allow you to enjoy an enhanced ride in their flagship S-Series automobiles with technology that provides a real-time Road Surface Scan with their Magic Body Control system to achieve a smooth ride.</p>

<p>This experience is achieved by using <a href="http://localhost:8888/sbaBK/2017/03/12/mercedes-benz-produces-cutting-edge-technologies-in-silicon-valley/">modern technology</a> to enable a smooth and comfortable ride in your car, giving you the luxurious experience you expect when driving. Mercedes-Benz has teamed up with technology innovators from Silicon Valley to produce astounding new high performance capability to allow a better ride with fewer bumps along your route.</p>

<p>The new technology involves using a camera attached to the exterior of the windshield to input real-time data.</p>

<p>This innovation allows the car to “see” and scan the surface the car is driving over in real-time. The Mercedes-Benz is equipped to anticipate upcoming road textures and surface conditions to be able to compensate for bumps and other adverse road coverings which would prevent a smooth ride. This data will eventually lead to the progression of the vehicle being able to <a href="{{ site.url }}/blog/mercedes-benz-self-driving-technology/">drive itself</a>.</p>

<p>This new Road Surface Scan feature, available in the Mercedes Benz flagship S-Class models, is an advanced technological replacement of the ABC technology used in past S-Class models, and is technologically superior to the previous ABC technology.</p>

<p>The new Mercedes-Benz feature is referred to as magic because of the effect the guidance the technology provides from its analysis of real-time data. The technology enables the car to avoid rough surfaces that would obliterate the smooth ride that Mercedes-Benz has earned its reputation from. Magic Body Control allows the car to avoid troublesome surfaces for comfort that ensures a smoother ride.</p>

<p>Being able to pursue the smoothest course available when guided by Mercedes-Benz Road Surface Scan and Magic Body Control system makes it possible for the driver to drive their <a href="{{ site.url }}/blog/mercedes-benz-crumple-zones-and-the-design-of-safety/">Mercedes-Benz safely</a> and in luxury, free of the problems caused by an uneven or unsafe road. The reliable guidance of this system allows Mercedes-Benz aficionados to ride in luxury regardless of the driving surface beneath them.</p>

<p>One of the best qualities about this Mercedes-Benz technology is that it functions as a part of the vehicle without diminishing the any performance of the vehicle, despite the systems added weight. The Road Surface Scan and Magic Body Control do not diminish the driving power of the car or any of its luxurious features.</p>

<p>The renowned Mercedes-Benz performance remains unhampered by the inclusion of this technology. The Mercedes-Benz owner can drive as usual, retain that top quality experience for which Mercedes-Benz is known, and remain undisturbed by the new diagnostic technology.</p>

<p>While many new technology releases from car manufacturers are frequently not as dazzling when first revealed, the Magic Body Control is as valuable and unique as it was initially claimed to be. Owners and drivers of new Mercedes S-Class vehicles are pleased to drive their vehicles that are factory-outfitted with the new detection system.</p>

<p>The incomparable experience of using Road Surface Scan and Magic Body Control has given a new definition to the meaning of a luxurious Mercedes-Benz experience.</p>
