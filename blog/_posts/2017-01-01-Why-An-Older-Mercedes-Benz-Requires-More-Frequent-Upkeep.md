<p>Often, <a href="https://www.autohaussouthbay.com/2017/03/17/getting-the-right-car-the-right-dealer-and-the-right-warranty-for-your-needs/">Mercedes-Benz sales agents</a> want you to quickly believe how your car will run forever without any service problems. Although an accurate statement on the quality of <a href="https://www.autohaussouthbay.com/2017/06/28/how-mercedes-amg-designs-and-builds-an-engine/">Mercedes-Benz design</a>, it should be noted that that won’t be possible without proper repair and maintenance.</p>
<p>A Mercedes-Benz will only serve the owner for many years if it’s given <a href="https://www.autohaussouthbay.com/2017/06/22/why-you-should-not-avoid-routine-mercedes-benz-maintenance/">constant attention and service</a>. Most Mercedes-Benz cars don’t receive this kind of care once the <a href="https://www.autohaussouthbay.com/2016/12/06/know-your-vehicle-warranty/">warranty</a> has expired. Most owners have a bad experience with <a href="https://www.autohaussouthbay.com/2016/11/25/why-the-independent-mercedes-benz-shop-is-your-best-choice/">franchised Mercedes-Benz dealerships</a> and so their cars don't often receive repairs or replacements for broken parts. Dealing with an older Mercedes-Benz requires even more time, care and attention though. &nbsp;That's why it's important to understand how to take maintain it and how to find a place to <a href="https://www.autohaussouthbay.com/2016/07/26/independent-vs-franchised-mercedes-benz-dealerships/">maintain your Mercedes-Benz</a>.</p>
<p>Once a Mercedes-Benz hits the 100,000-mile mark, this indicates that it can be considered an older Mercedes-Benz, even if not less than ten years old. This is more defined by the amount of mileage the vehicle has attained as well as the <a href="https://www.autohaussouthbay.com/2016/11/19/the-purpose-of-the-mercedes-benz-a-and-b-service-visits/">Mercedes-Benz service schedule</a> that has been maintained, especially after the factory warranty. Therefore, this type of vehicle requires a Service A&nbsp;type of maintenance. This is a precise form of care that will be done after a specified time. Here, the focus is to maintain the safety of the car and performance on the road. Without a robust and strict maintenance schedule, these two factors significantly decline over the years for an older Mercedes-Benz.</p>
<h5><strong>Maintain a Perfect Brake System</strong></h5>
<p>An older and&nbsp;<span class="scayt-misspell-word" data-scayt-word="unmaintained" data-scayt-lang="en_US">unmaintained</span>&nbsp;Mercedes-Benz will have worn out brakes. The primary concern of a dysfunctional <a href="https://www.autohaussouthbay.com/2017/05/03/picking-the-best-brakes-for-your-mercedes-benz/">brake system</a> is a car that does not stop at an efficient speed. The brake pads need frequent replacement. When these pads are not replaced at the required frequency, other parts of the brake system will end up malfunctioning. Brake pads are quite cheap as compared to replacing an <a href="https://www.autohaussouthbay.com/2017/05/09/mercedes-benz-ventilated-disc-brakes/">entire braking system</a>. Replacing brake rotors is also a significant step that will prevent any major replacement costs in the future. It is advisable to have a<a href="https://www.autohaussouthbay.com"> professional Mercedes-Benz technician</a> check your car in case one feels that the brakes do not function as they should.</p>
<h5><strong>Maintain Perfect Tires</strong></h5>
<p>Keeping <a href="https://www.autohaussouthbay.com/2017/04/02/the-importance-of-mercedes-benz-brake-and-tire-maintenance/">good tire treads</a> is a major safety concern for any driver. A worn out tire can cause a major accident by losing control of the vehicle on the road. Tire treads are even more important in wet conditions as they keep the car in perfect contact with the road. For car owners living in high precipitation areas, it is necessary to have regular checks on tire treads.</p>
<p>For a worn out tire, a professional Mercedes-Benz technician should help in determining whether the car needs tire replacements or not. An area that also needs attention is tire alignment. Ensuring the car has perfect tire alignment gives all <a href="https://www.autohaussouthbay.com/2017/04/25/what-is-it-that-makes-a-mercedes-benz-safer-and-a-dream-to-drive/">passengers a smooth ride</a>. This aspect of maintenance has nothing to do with the tires but the section that connects tires to the vehicle. A&nbsp;<span class="scayt-misspell-word" data-scayt-word="misaligned" data-scayt-lang="en_US">misaligned</span>&nbsp;car raises safety issues as it can significantly affect tire treads. Consequently, maintaining perfect alignment will reduce the cost of replacing tires due to worn out treads.</p>
<h5><strong>Maintain Proper Air and Dust Filters for Fuel Efficiency</strong></h5>
<p>Under the hood, the air filter is a major part that needs to be checked regularly. A Mercedes-Benz’s fuel typically gets mixed with air to produce the right amount of power. With time, the air filters get clogged with foreign particles picked from the atmosphere. These particles affect how the system <a href="https://www.autohaussouthbay.com/2017/05/06/select-the-right-fuel-for-your-mercedes-benz/">economically uses fuel</a>. An old Mercedes-Benz will also probably have problematic dust filters that will need replacement. Cleaning the air filter can significantly reduce fuel consumption of the car. These parts will need to be checked and occasionally replaced to ensure fuel economy and improved performance. Replacement of these crucial parts is also part of the safety measure for cars that have reached the 100,000-mile threshold.</p>
<h5><strong>Maintain Functional Warning Indicators</strong></h5>
<p>A Mercedes-Benz is indeed a marvel with numerous <a href="https://www.autohaussouthbay.com/2016/12/10/mercedes-benz-drive-assist-technology/">safety systems</a>. Some of these systems are located on the dashboard while others include seat belts, washer systems, and even windshield wipers. For an older Mercedes-Benz, all these need careful attention for safety reasons.</p>
<p>Since Mercedes-Benz occasionally changes <a href="https://www.autohaussouthbay.com/2017/04/18/mercedes-benz-oem-and-after-market-parts/">vendors and manufacturers</a> from time to time, more information about maintaining older vehicles can easily be found. An older Mercedes-Benz needs more attention than a new one. Safety and performance are the main reasons for these frequent checks and replacements. In return, the car owner will not incur major repair costs due to complete system failures or malfunction. However, all these need to be done by <a href="https://www.autohaussouthbay.com/staff/">professional Mercedes-Benz technicians</a> who know where to locate and purchase parts that need replacements. Car owners should be proactive on maintenance and follow maintenance schedules.</p>
