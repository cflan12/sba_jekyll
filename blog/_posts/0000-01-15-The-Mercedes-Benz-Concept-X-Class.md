<p>Mercedes-Benz has been continued to hint around producing a luxury pickup in the US market.</p>

<p>The company recently made it official with the unveiling of the Concept X-Class.</p>

<p>Covering all the gaps now in their product portfolio, from the <a href="https://www.autohaussouthbay.com/2016/07/26/mercedes-benz-gla45-amg-enters-the-compact-suv-market/">compact SUV</a> to the <a href="https://www.autohaussouthbay.com/2016/10/07/the-1-million-dollar-mercedes-benz/">$1 million dollar Pullman</a>, Mercedes-Benz unveiled two versions of the X-Class.</p>

<p>The Concept X-Class powerful adventurer has the looks of a rugged luxury off-roader, while the Concept X-Class stylish explorer is more suited for city and highway driving.</p>

<p>Unlike many concepts seen, the global launch of the Concept X-Class displays a product close to final design and production.</p>

<p>Mercedes-Benz has confirmed that when the X-Class gets to dealer lots, it will be a one-ton pickup with seating for up to five persons.
Dieter Zetsche, chairman of the board of Daimler AG and head of Mercedes-Benz Cars, expects the X-Class to <blockquote>“set new standards in a growing segment.”</blockquote>

<p>Most U.S. trucks are commonly the last models to receive technology upgrades, but the X-Class will include Mercedes-Benz’s latest <a href="https://www.autohaussouthbay.com/2016/07/26/mercedes-benz-apple-announce-carplay/">connectivity and safety technology</a>.</p>

<p>Owners will be able to link to the X-Class from their smartphones.</p>

<p>Cameras, radar and ultrasound sensors will work together to help keep the vehicle and its passengers safe, implementing the features of Mercedes-Benz autonomous driving.</p>

<p>Mercedes-Benz sees the most X-Class sales potential outside of the Unites States as well in Latin America, South America, South Africa, Australia, and Europe.</p>

<p>The X-Class has an expected late 2017 launch with key markets are named as Argentina, Brazil, South Africa, Australia, New Zealand and Europe.</p>

<p>On the outside, the Concept X-Class is all Mercedes. It has the face of a vehicle you’d recognize as being from the brand’s luxury design team, even without the three-point star, while the cab starts at a highly sloped a-pillar similar to the <a href="https://www.autohaussouthbay.com/2016/07/26/mercedes-benz-gla45-amg-enters-the-compact-suv-market/">Mercedes-Benz GLA</a>.</p>

<p>Its body exudes the strength buyers want from a pickup truck. The Concept X-Class tailgate is unique and likely something we’ll see change by the time the truck gets to production.</p>
