<p>When purchasing a vehicle, whether new or used, we often get tied up in the excitement of the buying process.</p>

<p>Often, there are so many things being thrown at us, different warranties, special deals, discounts, extended warranties, as well as the excitement of your purchase can one easily forget exactly how their vehicle is being covered.</p>

<p>While we have gone over some <a href="https://www.autohaussouthbay.com/2016/12/03/the-details-of-buying-new-used-or-leasing-a-car/">simple rules to help you when purchasing a car</a>, we also want to make sure that after your purchase you know what most warranties really provide to you as a consumer.</p>

<p>By making sure that you're following the required parameters set forth by your vehicle manufacturerâ€™s warranty, you can help ensure your car reaches its full potential while not facing an expensive repairs.</p>

<p>The routine service and maintenance schedule set forth by the manufacturer, and highly suggested to be continued after warranty, are the most crucial measures you can take to maintain your vehicle's value as well as preventing costly future repairs.</p>

<p>In order to get the most from your warranty, however, it is important that you understand it completely.</p>

<p>Though it is written in legal jargon, the Magnuson-Moss warranty law, passed in 1975, is designed to offer consumers valuable protections.</p>

<p>As such, there are important components that are valuable to keep in mind in regards your warranty.</p>

<p>This Congressional Act is designed to provide consumers with certain protections when they purchase products, such as a new vehicle.</p>

<p>This Act gives you a course of action that protects you against being liable for manufacturing defects, placing this responsibility on the manufacturer to produce a superior competitive product.</p>

<p>Your warranty only designates to the consumer correct <a href="https://www.autohaussouthbay.com/2016/11/19/the-purpose-of-the-mercedes-benz-a-and-b-service-visits/">scheduled servicing</a> in order to assist in maintaining the vehicle. What this Act and your warranty do not stipulate is where you must schedule these routine services of your vehicle.</p>

<p>It is a common misconception and marketing tactic for major franchised dealerships to explain that your recently purchased vehicle must be routinely serviced at their facility to prevent voiding your warranty.</p>

<p>As the law states, warranties protect consumers from manufacturing defects, not from the place of sale. Consumers need to be aware that they have the full ability and freedom to chose where they service their vehicle at any automotive center they feel provides them the highest quality for what they pay.</p>

<p>The <a href="https://www.autohaussouthbay.com/2016/07/26/independent-vs-franchised-mercedes-benz-dealerships/">franchised dealership</a> where you often purchase your car offers such services, but at a premium price due to their higher overhead costs.</p>

<p>In contrast, <a href="https://www.autohaussouthbay.com/2016/11/25/why-the-independent-mercedes-benz-shop-is-your-best-choice/">an independent dealership</a> offers the same exact services that are designed to keep your vehicle in peak working condition at a much more affordable price.</p>

<p>Don't be fooled by the marketing blitz that is often a part of the vehicle purchasing process. Many chose their vehicle for the quality, reliability and safety of their product, which they affirm with their provided warranty.</p>

<p>But you are under no obligation to return to your original point of purchase for the routine care and servicing of your car, it is important to search for a service center where you can establish trust and quality maintenance.</p>
