<p>Before you plan that next family road trip with the kids, it's just as important to plan some much needed entertainment for them to ensure your travel is a smooth and safe one.</p>

<p>With long days spent in the car, keeping the kids busy and having fun let's you get to enjoy driving your Mercedes-Benz while staying safe and undistracted.</p>

<p>We've compiled a list of some of the best kid friendly tech to integrate with your Mercedes-Benz to help you plan your entertainment strategy.</p>

<p><strong>DVD and Video</strong></p>

<p>Anyone can purchase those cheap plastic portable DVD players sold at department stores and big box retailers, but they certainly don't enhance the look of your vehicle one bit.</p>

<p>In fact, they can really detract from it, with wires hanging all over the place, the design of the device looking horrible or even clashing with your interior.</p>

<p>Plus, they often don't integrate well, even with their design claims that they're built to accommodate any vehicle use. This means they'll work, but they're ugly and annoying and can become a problem on the your trip.</p>

<p>Consider an integrated headrest in-laid display from a central DVD unit installed for your Mercedes-Benz. This can keep the kids occupied and entertained while maintaining a nice integration with the interior.</p>

<p>A professional installation only removes any concern of having to deal with a cheaper device not working during your trip.</p>

<p><strong>Computers and Tablets</strong></p>

<p>Another great integrated tech option for onboard entertainment for your kids are laptops and tablet devices.</p>

<p>While it's common to simply bring an iPad on the trip, you can also seamlessly integrate them into backside of the driver and passenger seats with a fold-up table for the screen and keyboard. This makes the design stylish and fitting to the Mercedes-Benz interior, but also allows for easier use for the kids.</p>

<p>A special mousepad for the car can also be integrated for use in the armrest of the backseat for children to use. This can also be a useful tool for e-readers to read ebooks or even a mobile office for parents to get some work done while someone else drives.</p>

<p><strong>Toy or book bag</strong></p>

<p>There are bags that are designed for use in the interior of your Mercedes-Benz that are designed with aesthetic appeal in mind, as well as tech integration with your car.</p>

<p>You can get grey, beige, black, etc. These bags can be attached to the headrests or other areas of the car to store toys, books or other items to keep the kids entertained. This is especially helpful for little one's or if you have a nanny playing with the kids in the backseat.</p>

<p><strong>Video Games</strong></p>

<p>Another great gadget idea for kids is video game console integration with the car. While also providing as a DVD player, entire gaming systems like Sony Playstation, Nintendo Wii and Microsoft Xbox consoles can be used with a power inverter attached to your car battery.</p>

<p>This allows the kids to play all the games they normally would at home with a powerful gaming console. Integration with in-seat head rests provides a clean design and tech savvy Mercedes-Benz.</p>

<p>Professional installation is recommended to achieve the best possible integration with your particular car.</p>

<p><strong>Internet Mobile WiFi and Bluetooth Technologies</strong></p>

<p>Your car can be turned into a mobile hotspot and total entertainment center with the right technology in place.</p>

<p>If your entertainment strategy for the kids is to simply give them an iPad for a long trip, you're going to be getting a very expensive bill with the ability to connect to a Wifi network.</p>

<p>In today's environment, it is totally possible to have a nearly totally connected car.</p>

<p>Connected car is a term used to identify cars that use technology to connect to local devices and the Internet. If your car does not have this feature onboard with the stock option, then you can opt to have it installed in your vehicle.</p>

<p>There are also portable Wifi hotspot devices for sale that require data plans, but save you money if you have multiple devices that are using data on a trip.</p>

<p>You can also buy similar portable devices to connect to your vehicle's audio or video components via bluetooth (such as premium quality headphones).</p>

<p>Kids nowadays are connected with multiple gadgets everywhere they go and they'll soon expect vehicles are just connected to the Internet as well.</p>

<p><strong>Other Ideas</strong></p>

<p>One idea for smaller children is to get a steering wheel for kids that can be brought into the car.</p>

<p>It can easily match the car's interior and children seem to really like them a lot.</p>

<p>Another idea is to get an educational gadget that can be brought on trips to help kids learn. Electronic dictionaries, puzzles/games, atlases and encyclopedias are good starting points.</p>

<p>The above solutions will help you achieve better integration with your vehicle, portable devices, onboard entertainment and games for kids in your Mercedes-Benz.</p>

<p>You don't want to be lugging all sorts of loose devices and other items that could get lost or damaged, not to mention damage your vehicle interior or just make it look really messy.</p>
