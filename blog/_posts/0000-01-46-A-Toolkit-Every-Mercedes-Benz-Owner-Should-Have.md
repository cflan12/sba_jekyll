<h1><strong>Your Mercedes-Benz Tool Kit</strong></h1>

<p>Every car owner knows that maintenance and upkeep is essential for keeping a healthy car. No one wants to find themselves at the mercy of expensive repairs, or worse, stranded on the side of the road. If you're an owner of a Mercedes-Benz, then you may have, at some point, found yourself lacking a tool that could have made your endeavors far more convenient. Below is a list of items that you may find beneficial to keep in your Mercedes-Benz tool kit.</p>

<p><strong>Mercedes-Benz Engine Mount Wrench</strong></p>

<p>The Mercedes-Benz engine mount wrenches are specifically designed to comply with the standards of Mercedes-Benz parts. Mercedes-Benz engine mounts have been known to need some TLC after around 100,000 miles. This is a must-have for any Mercedes-Benz owner, as it will help with the majority of tasks.</p>

<p><strong>Radio Cluster Removal Tool</strong></p>

<p>If you have the appropriate tool to get the job done, then taking apart the radio cluster on most Mercedes-Benz models is quick and easy. That is, IF you have the right tool. Without one, you may find yourself damaging the dashboard. A helpful benefit to this tool is that it can also be used to remove the instrument cluster.</p>

<p><strong>Mercedes-Benz Transmission Fluid Dipstick</strong></p>

<p>Mercedes-Benz originally stated that the 722.6 five-speed transmissions were sealed and would not require maintenance, but people eventually discovered that this was not exactly the case. It's still a smart move to provide some service to the transmission at around 60,000 miles, and it is not immune to oil leakage. A transmission fluid dipstick can help you to easily check the fluid levels yourself.</p>

<p><strong>Air Filter Removal Tool</strong></p>

<p>Sometimes you may just want to get the job done yourself.  That's why having an oil filter removal tool will come in handy. Removing a filter on a Mercedes-Benz is actually easier than most other brands of vehicle, but you still need the right tool for the job. A filter removal tool makes it as easy as pie.</p>

<p><strong>• Mercedes-Benz Interior Car Care Lotion</strong></p>

<p>Cleaning and maintaining the interior of your Mercedes-Benz is a very important task. Allowing the interior to degrade will significantly reduce its value and general appeal. Mercedes-Benz's car care lotion is formulated specifically to clean and leave a shine without attracting dust.</p>

<p><strong>Diagnostic Scanner</strong></p>

<p>Mercedes-Benz cars come equipped with an array of control units, and some even have as many as 50 units.  If any one of the sensors goes, then you could end up spending a lot of money to have a technician diagnose the problem. Having your own diagnostic scanner will allow you to figure out what the problem is without having to take your car to the shop.</p>

<p><strong>E-Torx Socket Wrench Set</strong></p>

<p>Mercedes-Benz uses E-Torx heads to attain the best torque transfer, so if you're planning on doing any maintenance on a Mercedes-Benz engine, you'll be wise to have a E-Torx socket set. Some say they may have even started using them to deter people from trying to tamper or modify the engine, but that's another story. A female set of E-Torx Star Sockets is a must have for all Mercedes-Benz tool kits.</p>
