<p>Many people get markedly annoyed when they are driving down the road and see their service light come on in their Mercedes-Benz.</p>

<p>Given the highest quality in engineering and technology, people are often confused and annoyed to think something is wrong with their vehicle.</p>

<p>This annoyance quickly turns to confusion when they see a letter and number code pop up. They may think that something is expensively wrong with their car.</p>

<p>They often wonder what is required at this service visit. Mercedes-Benz uses these codes as a cue to both the Mercedes-Benz repair shop and the driver to indicate what service is due for the car.</p>

<p>While many people may question the reason behind this inconvenience, this ultimately provides numerous benefits for both the car and the owner.</p>

<p>The A service is often the first service light that comes on for Mercedes-Benz owners. This service takes place after around one year or 10,000 miles, whichever comes first. After this, the services are at intervals of every 20,000 miles or two years.</p>

<p>At these visits, a handful of services are performed including motor oil replacement, oil filter replacement, the service of all other fluids, a brake inspection, and a tire inflation check. These are all important functions for the safety and efficiency of the car.</p>

<p>The oil is responsible for keeping the engine properly lubricated and maximizing fuel efficiency, an important method for keeping down a costly gas bill.</p>

<p>The brakes are obviously important for ensuring driver safety and efficient stopping.</p>

<p>Tire inflation matters because this influences fuel efficiency, braking distance, and car safety. The  optimal pressure changes depending on the season. The A service might be a minor inconvenience but it remains essential for the proper function of the car. This allows a Mercedes-Benz owner to keep their car functioning like new.</p>

<p>The Mercedes-Benz B service is a little more involved and the first B service doesn't take place until around 20,000 miles.</p>

<p>In addition to the services provided above (a person does not need to come in separately for the A and B services if needed at the same time), the B service also includes an exchange of the brake fluid and a cabin dust filter replacement. Additional equipment checks are performed depending on the vehicle's make and model, such as belt rotations or air conditioning filter checks.</p>

<p>In addition to replacing the fluids and checking the tires as above, other equipment checks are examined in detail to ensure that they are functioning properly. This is important for ensuring that passengers have safe air, the vehicle can stop appropriately, and maximizing the life out of the engine. B services might require a longer visit but are important for ensuring your Mercedes-Benz functions efficiently.</p>

<p>In the end, while the visits might be seem to be a headache, they wind up saving you a significant amount of time and money in the long run.</p>

<p>If the vehicle is driven until these parts or fluids completely worn out, the parts are bound to break and have to be replaced prematurely.</p>

<p>This requires a large check and an even longer visit than usual, often resulting in a surprising bill for expensive repair that could have been avoided.</p>

<p>Furthermore, if the parts go out in the middle of a drive, this places the driver and other drivers on the road at great peril. Therefore, these visits are in place to maximize the longevity of your Mercedes-Benz to maintain everyone's safety, while saving both the owner and the dealer time and money.</p>

<p>While proper maintenance might feel like an inconvenience, it is a major responsibility that comes with owning such an engineering and luxurious model as a Mercedes-Benz.
