<p>Vladimir Putin is one of Russia's most powerful modern leaders. Over the last few decades, he has held many positions in the Russian government including that of Prime Minister and President.</p>

<p>During his many years in office, security has been a huge concern for his government as well as for him personally. Some Russians disagree with his policies as do some people abroad who travel to Russia or do business there. As a result, those who guard him have been careful to pay close attention to making sure that Putin's protected no matter where he goes.</p>

<p>Given the need to keep him safe, it is no surprise to learn that hisÂ policy and needs extends even to the car he drives. Russians have been appreciative of luxurious automobiles for decades. The upper class Russian love their fine cars.</p>

<p>This is why it is no shock to learn that Putin, like so many of his fellow Russians, have turned to Mercedes-Benz to serve as his official car. This model, as is true for many models of Mercedez-Benz automobiles, offers an incredible combination of a mellow ride, a sumptuous interior and many useful security features.</p>

<p><strong>High Style in the Interior</strong></p>

<p>A Mercedes-Benz that is said to have served as Putin's official car is on the <a href="{{ site.url }}/blog/the-1-million-dollar-mercedes-benz/">market for over a million</a>. Like so many Mercedes-Benz cars on the market, this one is all about power, security and luxury at all points.</p>

<p>This is one car with an interior any passenger will find utterly delightful. The luxury starts the minute any buyer steps inside, where there's lots of room to stretch out and plenty of seating for several guests.</p>

<p>The plush interior is done in shades of soothing grey and black. Potential buyers, should they have the funds, will find an interior that speaks of comfort and relaxation even when on the road.</p>

<p>The interior seating is made from the finest quality leather. Carpeting is everywhere including the sides and the top of the car. There are two pairs of armchairs that face each other in the back while the front has room for the driver and any additional passengers.</p>

<p>There's also three separate rows of seating, allowing each person to have privacy and comfort. A console in the middle provides plenty of room for passengers to read up on the latest news while on their way to home or work.</p>

<p>Curtains are on all windows allowing for privacy and making the car free from prying eyes. The interior seating can be changed as necessary in order to allow for more leg room or for any additional passengers.</p>

<p><strong>Lots of Power</strong></p>

<p>While the interior is all about comfort, the rest of the car is all about power. At every turn, this is one car that helps demonstrate the full potential of the Mercedes-Benz line.</p>

<p>Those in search of power in this car will find it under the hood. The 394 PS 6.0-liter V12 engine. This means 294 kilowatts of overall power, allowing for speed and acceleration in one place. That was a lot of power back in the 1990's when the car was built.</p>

<p>It's still a lot of power for any car today, allowing the new owner to be assured of having the means to go as fast as they want when they want. While the car is powerful, like so many other class of this type, it's also designed to offer a smooth ride. The emphasis is on offering passengers protection from any bumps in the road no matter where they are.</p>

<p><strong>Security Features</strong></p>

<p>Another important aspect of this particular car are the many security features. Modern secure Mercedez-Benz models are noted for offering a ride that is also all about security and safety. Several security features help Putin and his ministers stay safe when traveling.</p>

<p>The entire body of the car is covered in armor. This is an easy way to help provide security in the event of an attack. The car has what is known as B6/B7 levels of ballistic protection.</p>

<p>This means that it can withstand many levels of attack including that of a direct bullet from a far distance. The heavy size of the car also means that it's hard to attack as it will remain low to the ground. All in all, this is one very safe car.</p>
