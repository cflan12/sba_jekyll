<p>Modern Mercedes-Benz vehicles feature sleek exterior designs, complex systems, sophisticated interiors and top-notch technology. Regardless of the model or class of Mercedes-Benz vehicle, you are likely to associate it with luxury, reliability, and performance.</p>

<p>This means that the process of designing and assembling the vehicles is complex and demands the use of highly skilled labor. It is also true that the process of producing Mercedes-Benz vehicles is highly mechanized.</p>

<p>The production process involves some important steps. All the steps are designed to ensure that only safe and quality cars are released into the market.</p>

<p><strong>The design process</strong></p>

<p>The work of designing the next Mercedes-Benz vehicle model requires both passion and attention to detail. The period between the start of the design process and the time when the vehicle model is accepted could be as long as three years.</p>

<p>During this period, designers invest their creativity and time in continuously improving their work so as to come up with the most suitable design. From the engaging an involving process of designing, the next Mercedes-Benz model arises.</p>

<p><strong>Design work involves teamwork</strong></p>

<p>The design process is as important a step in the Mercedes-Benz development process as any other step. The process involves a team of designers working together to create the car design in an artistic and sensuous way.</p>

<p>The process is also interdisciplinary, with the team of designers working closely with the production, engineering and research departments. This work will involve coordinating the dimensions of the vehicle, manufacturing processes, and material concepts to ensure that the vehicle is producible.</p>

<p><strong>The idea and sketch</strong></p>

<p>The design process starts with an idea before it is sketched on a sketchpad or a computer screen. This sketch will contain all the necessary geometric requirements at this stage.</p>

<p>The next step will involve transcribing the sketch in a way that makes the graphics, dimensions, and proportions more coherent. Fine tuning is then done on the clay model, allowing designers to view their work and analyze it. The car can also be envisioned in its real-life size, making it possible to make any adjustments that may be necessary.</p>

<p><strong>The first prototype</strong></p>

<p>The next stage of producing a Mercedes-Benz car will involve selecting the best designs and building them as clay for more assessment. A large team of experts will settle on the most suitable design, paving the way for the creation of the first prototype.</p>

<p>Although scanning and milling machines are used to create the prototype, details are made by hand. In the end, the prototype will be representative of the characteristics and features of the vehicle.</p>

<p><strong>The interior is formed</strong></p>

<p>The process of coming up with the interior is similar to that of creating the design of the car. The process begins with a sketch that creates a visual appeal and a sense of well-being. A clay model is then made so that the team can assess and choose the most aesthetically appealing and functional design.</p>

<p>At this stage, color, fabric, control and display elements are designed and adjusted to represent the luxury that Mercedes-Benz is associated with.</p>

<p><strong>The finale</strong></p>

<p>The final step involves combining the exterior and interior into one vehicle model. The team of experts will assemble the individually manufactured parts to complete the puzzle that is the new vehicle. Assembling the cars is a highly mechanized process that involves some degree of human labor.</p>

<p><strong>The fully assembled Mercedes-Benz is then released into the market for sale.</strong></p>

<p>Now that you have an idea of how Mercedes-Benz cars are produced, you can appreciate the level of skills and amount of work that go into making the automobile whose luxury and performance you enjoy. This process can also help you to know what features to look for when choosing the model and class of your next Mercedes-Benz car.</p>
