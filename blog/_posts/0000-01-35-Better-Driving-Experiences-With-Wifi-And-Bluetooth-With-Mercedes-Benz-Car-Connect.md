<p>As technology progresses, the world is changing to an age of connectivity. Mercedes-Benz has moved to another phase of connectivity which involves a multi-functional assistant plugged into your vehicle. Thanks to this connectivity, drivers can now interact and enjoy their drives. These systems provide intelligent information services for convenience and safety.</p>

<p>You can now turn your Mercedes Benz into to a Wi-Fi hotspot as well as connect it with Bluetooth devices. The two connections are very beneficial for drivers as you can learn more and improve performance.</p>

<p><strong>Bluetooth connectivity</strong></p>

<p>Setting up the Bluetooth connectivity between your Bluetooth compatible phone or device and your Mercedes-Benz is an easy and convenient way to do away with all distractions while driving. As a driver, you are aware of the risks associated with distractions when driving which is why you are advised to connect with Bluetooth.</p>

<p><strong>How it works</strong></p>

<p>The procedure is simple. All you need to do is:

<ul>
 	<li>Switch on your phone. Then ensure that Bluetooth is enabled on your phone.</li>
 	<li>Select the data connection, Bluetooth, and update.</li>
 	<li>Then follow the commands given to complete the procedure.</li>
 	<li>On your Mercedes Benz, choose the telephone icon.</li>
 	<li>You will be provided with a connect option, select it.</li>
 	<li>You will be presented with two options, search for phones or connect via phone. Choose the search for phone option as it is the easiest, but if it does not work, you can go with connecting via phone.</li>
 	<li>Begin the search. Your Mercedes-Benz will find a compatible device. If the search is a success, you will get the success screen. Select the device you wish to connect to. A message will be displayed on your device with a corresponding code and if it is correct, select yes. Verify the code and connect.</li>
</ul>

The device is now successfully linked to the car. You can then listen to songs from your media files or stream data through your phone.</p>

<p>The greatest advantage of the connection is that you can enjoy your ride with your mind fully concentrated on driving the vehicle.</p>
