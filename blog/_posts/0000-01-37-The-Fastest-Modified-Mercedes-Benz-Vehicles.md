<p>Improved Mercedes-Benz for the Speed Lovers</p>

<p>Think about cars and what comes to mind first is often speed and luxury. If that’s your case, and you love speed and have an appreciation for design, then the world’s fastest modified Mercedes-Benz cars are definitely the end of your quest.</p>

<p>Mercedes-Benz is a name known for its technically advanced, exceptionally good looking and remarkably fast sports cars. Apart from racing, Mercedes-Benz vehicles have unarguably been the fastest, finest, and most opulent vehicles ever made. With a few modifications by the aftermarket companies, modified Mercedes-Benz vehicles are redefining new dimensions of craftsmanship, performance, speed, and luxury.</p>

<p>Here is a list of some of the fastest modified Mercedes-Benz cars:</p>

<p><strong>Brabus Mercedes-Benz 800E</strong></p>

<img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1615" src="http://localhost:8888/sbaBK/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/937809.jpg" alt="" width="1000" height="568" />

<p>Founded in 1977 and headquartered in Bottrop, Germany, Brabus is the name that specializes in producing high-performance aftermarket tuned Mercedes-Benz cars. Brabus holds the accolade for producing the world’s fastest sedans and cabriolets, the latest addition being the Brabus Mercedes 800 E V12 cabriolet.</p>

<p>With a three-valved Mercedes S 600 V12 engine and V12 Brabus motor, Brabus Mercedes-Benz holds an engine capacity of 6.3 liters and produces 788 bhp which is equivalent to 588 kW @ 5,500 rpm thereby producing a peak torque of 1,420 Nm.</p>

<p>While the numerical jargons may look overwhelming, what it means is that this Brabus Mercedes-Benz can accelerate from a halt to 100 km/h speed within 3.7 seconds, pass 200 km/h in just 10 seconds and reach 300km/h in mere 23.9 seconds. If we analyze final drive ratio, the Brabus Mercedes-Benz 800 E V12 cabriolet tops with 370 km/h that means 231 mph.</p>

<p>All this has resulted from a lot of re-engineering. Different camshafts, new intake manifold, flowed heads, new exhaust manifold integrated with large turbos, new stainless steel high flow exhaust system, four water-to-air intercoolers, multi-speed automatic transmission, refined aerodynamically enhanced components in the wind tunnel crafted from carbon fiber, as well as newly programmed mapping have all contributed to the robustness of all new Brabus Mercedes-Benz design.</p>

<p>Ultra-wide 9.5Jx19 wheels with 265/30 ZR 19 tires, 380 x 37 millimeter grooved and vented steel disc brakes, and 12-piston fixed calipers made of aluminum on the front axle together contribute to the high performance of Brabus the Mercedes-Benz 800E.</p>

<p>Beautified by black and lipstick-red leather cockpit, ergonomically shaped steering wheel, as well as inlays crafted with genuine carbon fiber on the center console, dashboard, and side trim, make this Brabus Mercedes-Benz a perfect combination of sporty spirit and style. Professionally engineered after investing in every minute detail, Brabus Mercedes-benz is definitely a realization of perfection personified.</p>

<p><strong>Mercedes-Benz S63 AMG Mansory</strong></p>

<p>Founded in 1989 and headquartered in Brand, Germany; Mansory is a brand known for luxury car modification. Their latest modification with the Mercedes-Benz S63 AMG claims to produce a clean cool one thousand horsepower vehicle.</p>

<p>You can opt for an M800 pack bundled with a paltry 800bhp and 885 lb-ft of torque that is available between the window of 1,700rpm and 3,500rpm. Pairing it up with a sports exhaust, you can sprint from 0-62mph in a mere 3.6 seconds. With an M1000 performance kit bundled with big end bearings, new connecting rods, new crankshaft, new turbo, bearing bushings, improved suction and compressor system, and many other similar modifications think of the torque it can achieve. Mansory has also fabricated an all new pipe fan manifold to achieve the 1,000 bhp and a massive 1,032 lb-ft of torque.</p>

<p><strong>Carlsson Mercedes-Benz SL 55 AMG</strong></p>

Need to add some torque to your very own Mercedes-Benz? Contact Carlssons. Their latest release is the SL 55 AMG.</p>

<p>On a road surface made up of dry asphalt, Carlsson SL55 uses traction control upon a higher gear on the mayhem scale. The credit goes to the Carlsson CK RS 580 bhp performance kit. Imagine the torque! It's 575 lb-ft at 2700 rpm. With so much power, Carlsson Mercedes-Benz is a must-have dream for the speed freaks.</p>

<p>Modifications in the Carlsson Mercedes-Benz include alteration in intake and induction systems, modification in drive pulley and supercharger, replacement of the exhaust, splicing supplementary engine management unit, and tweaks in the gearbox software. If you ignore the harsh kick down, and random shifts, Carlsson Mercedes-Benz will not leave you unimpressed.
