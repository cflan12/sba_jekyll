<p>The Vision Mercedes-Maybach 6 has been Mercedes-Benz newest concept car introduced to the world of luxury sport vehicles. Initially unveiled at the Pebble Beach Concours d’Elegance and then the Paris Motor Show, many have taken a supreme liking to the beauty and uniqueness of the vehicle.</p>

<p>The vehicle rivals such high end performance luxury cars like the Rolls-Royce Wraith or Bentley Phantom, though Mercedes-Benz has already entered those markets with the re-introduction of the Mercedes-Maybach.</p>

<p>This is different though, a luxury sports car with performance that is unmatched by competitors and eco-friendly. Even Tesla will have a hard time competing with Mercedes-Benz on such a design.</p>


<p>The project began in January of 2016 and was headed by former Ford designer Stefan Lamm. It is a very long sports car, measuring 18 feet but providing a very sleek and futuristic design.</p>

<p>The vehicle is a two seater luxury coupe sports car, as expected from such a design team, but the unique aspect of such a futuristic vehicle is that it is driven by an electric powertrain powered by 4 electric batteries.</p>

<p>This allows the vehicle to reach 0 - 60 mph in under 4 seconds with 750 hp and a top speed of 155mph.</p>

<p>As Mercedes-Benz continues to innovate with technological advances, the Mercedes-Maybach features not only gullwing style doors but a widescreen that displays information to the driver.</p>

<p>Mercedes-Benz also included the ability for quick charge, a 5 minute charge that would provide the vehicle with another 100km range.</p>

<p>The car is also outfitted with autonomous driving capabilities, as Mercedes-Benz has continually progressing in self-driving vehicles. The continued hesitancy to utilize such systems seems to be regulation vs safety issue.</p>

<p>The vehicle’s sleek exterior design is matched with its sleek interior, including a set of handmade Mercedes-Benz luggage to fit the vehicle. The futuristic exterior look is accented by the sleek lights, mirrors and large grille.</p>

<p>The electric powertrain batteries, which provide 80kWh of power, allow for a range of 310 miles, beating the Tesla S range of 265 miles.</p>

<p>While Mercedes-Benz has not discussed if this is merely a concept model to display their technological innovation that will come to future vehicles, many believe a V12 engine would certainly fit under the hood and Mercedes could provide a limited edition version.</p>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">As Mercedes-AMG continue to progress on high end sports car, like the Mercedes-AMG GT, it would not be a surprise to see such a vehicle come to the production line for high end consumers looking for an alternative to Tesla if the electric powertrain remains. </span>
