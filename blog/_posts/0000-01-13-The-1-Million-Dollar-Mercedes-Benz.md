<p>The Mercedes-Maybach S600 Pullman is a luxury limousine designed for those who are executive businessmen, politicians and any concerned individuals wanting a combination of safety and high end luxury. At a $1 million price tag, the Mercedes-Benz Pullman comes with every feature and more that you would expect from such a vehicle and quality producer like Mercedes-Maybach.</p>

<p>This is luxury on the largest scale possible. With the return of the Mercedes-Maybach S600 and the redesigned and opulent Mercedes-Benz S-Class in the last few years, it was only a matter of time before Mercedes-Benz pulled out the ultimate in luxury with the Pullman series.</p>

<p>While Mercedes-Benz continues to innovate with the <a href="https://www.autohaussouthbay.com/2016/09/30/the-mercedes-maybach-vision-6/">Vision Mercedes-Maybach 6</a> and <a href="https://www.autohaussouthbay.com/2016/10/03/the-mercedes-benz-generation-eq-takes-on-tesla/">Mercedes-Benz Generation EQ</a>, they still maintain a committed loyalty to luxury and prestige.</p>

<p>This is the top of the line in the sense of quality, as not only is this luxury in the most opulent sense of any Mercedes-MaybachÂ Pullman iteration, but this vehicle also comes fully armored and bulletproof.</p>

<p>Mercedes-Benz has continuously focused on bringing their relationship with Mercedes-AMG and Mercedes-Maybach in order to capture the high end consumer market.</p>

<p>As BMW has slowly lost market share to Mercedes-Benz, with the production of the Mercedes-Benz CLA and <a href="https://www.autohaussouthbay.com/2016/07/26/mercedes-benz-gla45-amg-enters-the-compact-suv-market/">Mercedes-Benz GLA</a>, Mercedes-Benz has had the foresight to keep a foot in each luxury market.</p>

<p>The Mercedes-Maybach S600 Pullman itself is 21 feet long, adding another 4 feet to the Mercedes-Benz S-Class. In addition, Mercedes-Benz has added some headroom, adding an additional 4 inches to the height of the vehicle.</p>

<p>The design of the Pullman, similar to the customized mobile office of the <a href="https://www.autohaussouthbay.com/2016/09/28/mercedes-benz-sprinter-van-customizations/">Mercedes-Benz Sprinter Vans</a>, is that of a club type lounge area. Without customization, although those with $1 million to spend do in fact customize, the Pullman comes with an office like configuration. Two chairs facing forward and two rear seats that fold down to allow for VIP guests. Many though often chose a custom design specific to their tastes and needs in such a vehicle.</p>

<p>The limousine aspect of the vehicle includes an electric partition for the rear and front seats, with the ability to chose between clear and opaque glass if needed.</p>

<p>The standard model provides an 18.5 inch monitor and a high end Burmester stereo system. As well, for privacy like the Mercedes-Maybach S600, the Pullman includes wide C-pillar and window curtains.</p>

<p>For such a heavy duty vehicle, power is a necessity. As Mercedes-AMG continues to improve on innovation and performance as a single unit, the Pullman exemplifies this. The vehicle has 523 hp with a 6.0 liter twin turbo V12.</p>

<p>With the armored option of the Mercedes-Maybach S600, the vehicle comes with integrated steel protection panels inside the body with overlapping protection panels in areas critical to the vehicle.</p>

<p>Armored floors are added for bomb blasts and ultra thick laminated glass windows are coated with polycarbonate to prevent splintering.</p>

<p>The car is designed and built with politicians, dignitaries, royalty and those seeking safety in mind. The vehicle can also be fitted with sirens, flashing lights, an emergency battery and external communications systems.</p>

<p>While the vehicle will come to the US market, it is mainly focused on the Russian and Chinese market, similar to the <a href="https://www.autohaussouthbay.com/2016/09/28/mercedes-benz-sprinter-van-customizations/">customized Mercedes-Benz Sprinter Vans</a> that have taken the streets of Mumbai and traffic jammed countries.</p>
