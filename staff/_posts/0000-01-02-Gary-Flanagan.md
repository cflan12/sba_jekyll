<p>Gary has always had a passion for luxury automobiles. After he was hired by El Cajon Mercedes Benz in 1982, he knew this was what he always wanted to do. He worked as a Master Technician from 1982 until 1993. In 1994 he and Rick Stafford opened South Bay Autohaus. His dream was to build a full Independent Mercedes Benz facility with a service department, sales showroom, and parts department with a great reputation. They have been able to accomplish this through hard work, honesty, and fairness.<p>
